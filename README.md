**Clean Vision**
Deep Learning-Based Waste Classification for Smart Waste Management

Clean Vision is a deep learning–powered waste classification system designed to enhance smart waste management through automated image-based sorting.
The model classifies waste into Organic and Recyclable categories using modern CNN architectures trained on a large public dataset.

**Dataset**

Source: Waste Classification Data (Kaggle)
Total Images: 22,000+
Categories: Organic, Recyclable

**Preprocessing Steps**
Image resizing to 224×224
Normalization
Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom, shift)

**Models Trained**
Model	Accuracy	Epochs	Notes
EfficientNet-B0	97.2%	30–50	Best performing model
MobileNetV2	95.6%	30–50	Lightweight, fast on edge devices
ResNet50	92.4%	30–50	Stable baseline model

All models were trained using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU
Optimization: Adam optimizer, Early stopping, and Learning rate scheduling
Achieved high accuracy with limited overfitting
